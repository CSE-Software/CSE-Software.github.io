## What is Kanban?

[Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) is a useful tool for managing and optimizing workflow. 
Researchers often use Kanban board to organize their works. There are different kinds of Kanban board, but the general
Kanban board has to contain at least 3 columns: to do, in progress, and done. <br>
You can see example of Kanban board [here](https://leankit.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-SmalDevelopmentTeamKanbanBoard-eb79376d-1024x647.png). <br>

## How can I run my CSE SW project meeting?

 To achieve effective project meeting, follow these resources:

 * [Everything You Need to Know About Running a Project Meeting](http://www.amanet.org/training/articles/Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Running-a-Project-Meeting.aspx)

## How can I do testing from the beginning?

[Software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) is an attempt to find mistake in the code.
Testing successfully can avoids system failures, which may lead to disasters
Because of its important, testing has to be implemented since the beginning.
For testing from the beginning, [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) is recommended.
Unit testing is the testing of individual function or class in a part of bigger project. 
This helps early detect the error, therefore avoids wasting time and resources as project develops.
After that, we can implement [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) and 
[System testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_testing).
Here are some good resources on testing to get started with:

## How can I prepare for next generation HPC platforms?

[High performance computing](http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/definition/high-performance-computing)(HPC)
 also called supercomputing, uses the [parallel computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) 
 for running program in a quick and reliable way. Next generation of HPC platforms will be
