## Introduction

[Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) now becomes essential part in our modern world. 
Mastering software is required for all computer science researchers and students. 
Learning more about software [here](https://collegeville.github.io/Lex/index.html). <br>
[Computational Science and Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering) (CSE)
is about "development processes for software for computational science and engineering and related technical computing areas, 
with a particular interest in CSE on high-performance (parallel) computers."
Visit our [CSE website](https://cse-software.org/) for full detail.


## Online courses

* [Software development process](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-development-process--ud805)<br>
* [Contrucx courses](http://ondemand.construx.com/catalog/)<br>
* [Software carpentry lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)

## Tools and techinques

Software tool and techniques effect on reducing software cost and time.
Starting to learn by looking at this [overview](http://www.gao.gov/assets/200/192021.pdf) 

### Common tool:

A popular tool used in software is [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).
Here are some good resources for getting started: 

* [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
* [Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/)
* [GitHub tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Git Tutorial and Reference Collection Introduction](https://ideas-productivity.org/resources/howtos/git-tutorial-and-reference-collection/)

Another useful tool is [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
Here are some good resources for getting started:

* [Eclipse And Java: Free Video Tutorials](http://eclipsetutorial.sourceforge.net/totalbeginner.html)
* [Eclipse Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/eclipse/)

[CppUnit](http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/cvs/cppunit_cookbook.html) is the famous JUnit framework for unit testing.
Download CppUnit [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/)

### Techniques

There are some useful techniques using on CSE software:

* [Continuous Integration](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration)
* [Automated Testing](https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/)
* [Test Driven Development](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html)
* [Pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/)
* [Design Patterns](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/design_pattern_overview.htm)
* [Code refactoring](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r95004/Refactoring_improving_the_design_of_existing_code.pdf)
