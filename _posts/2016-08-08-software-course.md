### Introduction
[Software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) now becomes very important in daily life. 
Mastering software is required for all computer science students.
You can read more about software [here](https://collegeville.github.io/Lex/SoftwareEngineeringBasics.html).

### Online courses
* [Software development process](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-development-process--ud805)<br>
* [Contrucx courses](http://ondemand.construx.com/catalog/)<br>
* [Software carpentry lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)

### Tools and techinques
Software tool and techniques effect on reducing software cost and time.
Starting to learn by looking at this [overview](http://www.gao.gov/assets/200/192021.pdf) 

#### Common tool:
A popular tool used in software is [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).
Here are some good resources: <br>

* [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

### What is Kanban?

[Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) is a useful tool for managing and optimizing workflow. 
You can see example of Kanban board [here](https://leankit.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-SmalDevelopmentTeamKanbanBoard-eb79376d-1024x647.png)
