<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in this topic, as a software developer or another kind of stakeholder;
as someone with experience to share or someone wanting to learn more, please start by
<a href="">joining the cse-forum mailing list</a> to join in discussions and see relevant announcements.</p>

<p>If you prefer to receive only the announcements of relevant events and formation of new working groups,
<a href="">join the cse-announce mailing list</a> (announcements will also be sent to the cse-forum list,
so you do not need to subscribe to both).</p>

<h2>Working Groups</h2>

<p>We will form working groups to discuss various software development topics, gathering and discussing experiences and
distilling them into best practices, how-tos, and other documents which will be available to the community.
Working groups will have their own section on this site and their own mailing lists.
<a href="">Join working groups</a> that interest you. New working groups may be suggested on the <a href="">cse-forum mailing list</a>.</p>
