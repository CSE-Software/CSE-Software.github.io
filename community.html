<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in this topic, as a software developer or another kind of stakeholder;
as someone with experience to share or someone wanting to learn more, please start by
[joining the cse-forum mailing list]() to join in discussions and see relevant announcements.</p>

<p>If you prefer to receive only the announcements of relevant events and formation of new working groups,
[join the cse-announce mailing list]()
(announcements will also be sent to the cse-forum list, so you do not need to subscribe to both).</p>

<h2>Working Groups</h2>

<p>We will form working groups to discuss various software development topics, gathering and discussing experiences and
distilling them into best practices, how-tos, and other documents which will be available to the community.
Working groups will have their own section on this site and their own mailing lists.
[Join working groups]() that interest you. New working groups may be suggested on the [cse-forum mailing list]().</p>
